# Is-Iss-Over-You

Checks if the International Space Station is visible from your location or not.

## Getting Started

Ideally, the ISS is set to visible to your location if

* The weather is clear.
* ISS is above horizon @ ~10% accounting for mountains, trees, and/or other objects.
* "did_the_chinese_blow_it_up" is set to 0.


### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern browser which supports getting your current location.

### Cookies

This project uses persistant cookies which expire 48 hours after you visit this page and allow your location. This is required because ISS location updates every few seconds and it'd be a pain for you to get "allow current location" popups constantly.
